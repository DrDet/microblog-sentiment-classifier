RESOURCE: English Social Media Normalisation Lexicon

VERSION: 1.0

LAST UPDATE: Jul 12, 2012

DESCRIPTION: (As requested by many researchers in EMNLP poster session, we will update the lexicon with context/string similarity scores.)
This is the dataset used for lexical normalisation described in: Automatically Constructing a Normalisation Dictionary for Microblogs

The dictionary contains about 40K (lexical variant, normalisation) pairs mined from 80 million English tweets from September 2010 to January 2011. Each line in the dictionary file is an entry (OOV and IV separated by '\t'). All pairs are in lower case.
For instance:
fundation   foundation
discribed   described
screaminq   screaming
...

Note the lexicon is automatically generated without any post-processing, and may therefore contain errors.

If you have powerful computing facilities, we recommend you to derive your own lexicon using more data with the optimised parameters as specified in the paper. We expect the quality and quantity of the lexicon can be further improved. As for the development data, you can use this lexicon as a sliver standard.
